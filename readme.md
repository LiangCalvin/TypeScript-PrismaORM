# TypeScript + Prisma ORM Project

This project is a demonstration of building a web application using TypeScript and Prisma ORM for efficient database interactions. It showcases how to set up a project with Prisma ORM, define database models using Prisma schema, and perform CRUD operations on the database.

## Features

- **TypeScript**: Utilizes TypeScript for type-safe development, providing better code quality and developer productivity.
- **Prisma ORM**: Demonstrates the usage of Prisma ORM for interacting with the database, including defining models, performing queries, and executing migrations.
- **Database Schema**: Includes a sample database schema defined using Prisma schema language, showcasing relationships between different entities.
- **CRUD Operations**: Illustrates how to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on the database using Prisma Client.
- **Error Handling**: Implements error handling mechanisms to handle exceptions and ensure robustness in database interactions.
- **Usage of Prisma Studio**: Optionally, includes usage of Prisma Studio for visualizing and managing the database schema and data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your local machine
- A database server (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) or Docker installed if you're using a Dockerized database

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git

1. Navigate to the project directory:
cd your-repository

2. Install dependencies:
npm install

# Usage
Set up your database connection:

- Create a .env file in the root directory.
- Define your database connection URL in the .env file:
DATABASE_URL="your-database-connection-url"

2. Run database migrations:
npx prisma migrate dev

3. Run the application:
npm start or npx ts-node index.ts

4. Explore the code:

- Review the Prisma schema file (prisma/schema.prisma) to understand the database schema.
- Explore the TypeScript files in the src directory to see how Prisma ORM is used for database interactions.
